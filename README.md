# Resume Screening App using Machine Learning and NLP

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
The Resume Screening App is an AI-powered application designed to **automatically analyze and filter resumes** based on predefined criteria like skills, experience, education, etc. It helps recruiters quickly identify the most suitable candidates for a job by leveraging techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

---

## âœ… Features
- Extracts text from resumes (PDF, DOCX).
- Cleans and preprocesses text data.
- Extracts key information such as skills, experience, and education.
- Uses NLP models for keyword matching and semantic understanding.
- Classifies resumes as "Suitable" or "Not Suitable" based on requirements.
- Provides a simple user interface for uploading resumes and displaying results.
- Can be expanded with advanced features like Named Entity Recognition (NER).
